## Avoiding Duplication

This outline provides **summary information only**. Detailed tracking lives in the manifest:

```yaml
# See /_tracking/course-manifest-csc134.yaml for:
# - Complete deliverable lists per module
# - Status of each assignment (complete/draft/planned)
# - Progress percentages
# - File paths to all materials
```

When updating course content:
1. Update the manifest first (source of truth)
2. Update this outline only for structural changes
