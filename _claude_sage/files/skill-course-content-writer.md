# Course Content Writer

This skill establishes the foundational voice and approach for all CSC-113 content. It activates alongside other skills when content creation is involved.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating any student-facing content
- Reviewing content for voice consistency
- Adapting external materials to course style
- When asked about "how to write for this course"

## The CSC-113 Voice

### Core Tenet: "Failure is Just Exercise"

This isn't a throwaway phrase—it's the pedagogical foundation:

1. **Normalize iteration**: Professional developers don't get things right the first time
2. **Remove shame**: Mistakes are data, not character flaws
3. **Build resilience**: The skill is recovering, not avoiding failure
4. **Model reality**: Real work involves constant revision

### Tone Calibration

**Warm but not infantilizing**:
- ✅ "This concept takes time to click—let's work through it together"
- ❌ "Don't worry, this is super easy!"

**Honest but not discouraging**:
- ✅ "This is genuinely challenging. Here's why it's worth the effort..."
- ❌ "This is the hardest part of the course and many people struggle"

**Professional but not cold**:
- ✅ "In industry, teams handle this by..."
- ❌ "The correct methodology requires..."

**Accessible but not dumbed-down**:
- ✅ "Machine learning means the system improves by finding patterns in examples"
- ❌ "It's like magic but with math" 
- ❌ "Utilizing stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms..."

### Inclusive Language Patterns

**Acknowledge diverse starting points**:
> "Whether you've been coding for years or this is your first time seeing a terminal..."

**Respect time constraints**:
> "If you're short on time, focus on sections 1 and 3. Section 2 is valuable but optional."

**Validate non-traditional paths**:
> "Career changers often bring insights that traditional CS students miss."

### Avoid These Patterns

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Simply..." | "Here's how to..." |
| "Obviously..." | "Note that..." |
| "Just do X" | "You can X by..." |
| "Everyone knows..." | "A key concept is..." |
| "Easy" | "Straightforward" |
| "Stupid mistake" | "Common pitfall" |

## Structural Principles

### The 2-Minute Rule
Every section should deliver value within 2 minutes of starting. Front-load the "why this matters."

### Concrete Before Abstract
1. Show a specific example
2. Then explain the pattern
3. Then generalize the principle

### Multiple Entry Points
For each concept, provide:
- A quick summary (for experienced learners)
- A detailed explanation (for those who need it)
- A "real world" connection (for motivation)

### Signposting
Always tell readers:
- What they'll learn
- Why it matters
- How long it takes
- What they need before starting

## GitHub Integration

All content should reinforce GitHub-first habits:

**Reference the workflow**:
> "As you work through this reading, you might notice questions. Create an Issue in your learning journal to capture them."

**Connect to portfolio**:
> "The lab you're about to complete will become part of your professional portfolio."

**Normalize the process**:
> "If you're feeling uncertain about the Git commands, that's completely normal. Most developers look things up constantly."

## Quality Checklist

Content meets CSC-113 standards when:

- [ ] Uses "we/you" language (not "the student")
- [ ] Includes time estimates for activities
- [ ] Has clear learning objectives stated upfront
- [ ] Contains at least one concrete example per major concept
- [ ] Acknowledges difficulty without discouraging
- [ ] Connects to real-world relevance
- [ ] References GitHub workflow where applicable
- [ ] Free of jargon (or defines jargon on first use)
- [ ] Includes reflection questions or next steps
- [ ] Tested for reading at appropriate level (aim for grade 10-12)

## Voice Test

Read content aloud. Ask:
1. Does it sound like a supportive mentor?
2. Would a 45-year-old career changer feel respected?
3. Would an 18-year-old feel challenged?
4. Does it convey expertise without arrogance?

If any answer is "no," revise.
