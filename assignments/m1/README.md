# Module 1: Variables and Basic I/O

## Module Overview
This module introduces students to C++ programming through practical, real-world problems. Students progress from basic output to complex calculations with user input, building confidence and skills incrementally.

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundation
- **M1T1: Your First Day as a Developer** - Environment setup and Hello World
- **M1T2: Digital Business Card** - Variables and formatted output

### Week 2: Application
- **M1LAB: Coffee Shop POS System** - Calculations and business logic
- **M1HW1: Student Budget Analyzer** - User input and complex analysis

## Assignment Summaries

### M1T1: Your First Day as a Developer
Students set up their development environment in GitHub Codespaces and create their first program, establishing professional coding practices from day one.
- **Skills:** Environment setup, compilation, Git workflow
- **Deliverable:** Working Hello World program with professional documentation

### M1T2: Digital Business Card
Students create a formatted digital business card using variables, learning to organize and present information professionally.
- **Skills:** Variable declaration, data types, output formatting
- **Deliverable:** Formatted business card with calculated elements

### M1LAB: Coffee Shop POS System
Students build a point-of-sale system for a campus coffee shop, implementing real business calculations including discounts and tax.
- **Skills:** Arithmetic operations, business logic, receipt formatting
- **Deliverable:** Complete POS system with professional receipt output

### M1HW1: Student Budget Analyzer
The culminating project where students create an interactive budget analysis tool, combining all module concepts into a genuinely useful application.
- **Skills:** User input, complex calculations, data analysis, recommendations
- **Deliverable:** Interactive budget analyzer with personalized insights

## Key Pedagogical Features

### Problem-Based Learning
Each assignment starts with a realistic scenario that students can relate to:
- New developer joining a team
- Creating networking materials
- Helping a local business
- Solving personal finance challenges

### Progressive Complexity
- 20% difficulty: Environment setup (M1T1)
- 35% difficulty: Variables and output (M1T2)
- 55% difficulty: Calculations (M1LAB)
- 75% difficulty: Full interaction (M1HW1)

### Multiple Learning Styles
- **Visual:** Formatted output, receipts, and reports
- **Kinesthetic:** Hands-on coding with immediate results
- **Read/Write:** Comprehensive instructions and documentation
- **Aural:** Optional video walkthroughs available

## Assessment Strategy

### Consistent Rubric Categories
All assignments evaluated on:
1. Functionality (35-40%)
2. Code Quality (20-25%)
3. Documentation (15-20%)
4. Professional Practice (10-15%)
5. Problem Solving (10-15%)

### Growth Mindset Encouragement
- Optional bonus challenges on each assignment
- Opportunities to revise and resubmit
- Focus on improvement over perfection

## Module Resources

### Required Tools
- GitHub account
- GitHub Codespaces access
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Support Materials
- Video walkthroughs for each assignment
- Discussion board for peer support
- Sample solutions (released after due dates)
- Office hours for individual help

## Success Metrics
By completing this module, students will be able to:
- ✅ Set up and use a professional development environment
- ✅ Declare and use variables of different data types
- ✅ Perform calculations with proper precision
- ✅ Format output professionally
- ✅ Gather and process user input
- ✅ Follow Git workflow practices
- ✅ Write documented, readable code
- ✅ Solve real-world problems with programming

## Common Student Challenges

### Technical Issues
- **Codespaces not loading:** Clear browser cache, try different browser
- **Compilation errors:** Usually typos or missing semicolons
- **Git authentication:** Codespaces should handle automatically

### Conceptual Difficulties
- **Data types:** Why use int vs. double?
- **Variable scope:** Where variables can be used
- **Order of operations:** Mathematical precedence

### Solutions Provided
- Detailed error message explanations in each assignment
- Common issues sections with fixes
- Step-by-step debugging guidance

## Instructor Notes

### Pacing Recommendations
- Allow 2-3 hours for M1T1 (includes setup time)
- M1T2: 1-2 hours
- M1LAB: 2-3 hours
- M1HW1: 3-4 hours

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Advanced students:** Bonus challenges on each assignment
- **Struggling students:** Pair programming encouraged
- **Different backgrounds:** Multiple example domains

### Key Teaching Points
1. **Variables are containers** - Use physical box analogy
2. **Data types matter** - Money needs decimals, counts don't
3. **Input-Process-Output** - Universal program pattern
4. **Test frequently** - Compile and run after each section

## Looking Ahead
Module 2 will introduce selection statements (if/else), allowing programs to make decisions. Students will enhance their Module 1 projects with conditional logic, creating even more sophisticated and useful applications.

## Module Reflection
This module transforms students from having never written code to creating genuinely useful applications. The progression from "Hello World" to a full budget analyzer in just two weeks demonstrates the power of structured learning and practical application.

The real-world focus ensures students see immediate value in their learning, while professional practices prepare them for industry expectations. By the end of Module 1, students have not just learned syntax, but have begun thinking like programmers.
