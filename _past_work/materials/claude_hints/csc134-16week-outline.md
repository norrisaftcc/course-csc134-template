| 2 | Fundamental Data Types + const | RPG Stats System | C++ Syntax basics |
| 3 | Decisions (if/else) | CYOA begins | Control Structures |
| 4 | Decisions (switch, ternary) | **Project 1 Due** | Program Design |
| 5 | Loops (while/for) | Combat system | Control Structures |
| 6 | Loops (algorithms preview) | Dungeon generation | Testing and Debugging |
| 7 | Functions + First-class concepts | Scene refactoring | Software Practices |
| 8 | Functions + Recursion | **Project 2 Due** (C achieved) | Program Implementation |

### Phase 2: AI-Assisted Engineering (Weeks 9-12) - "Build Your B"
**Badge Objective**: Object-Oriented Programming + Software Development Practices

| Week | Topic | AI Integration | Badge Alignment |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 9 | Arrays + AI Tools + STL Algorithms | Code generation begins, heavy STL focus | Software Development Practices |
| 10 | File I/O + Functional Patterns | AI for boilerplate, streams as transformations | Testing and Debugging |
| 11 | Classes (Intro) + Immutability | AI-assisted design, value objects | Object-Oriented Programming |
| 12 | Classes (Advanced) + Lambdas | **Project 3 Due** (B achieved) | OOP + Testing |

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Weeks 13-15) - "Achieve Your A"
**Badge Objective**: Complete portfolio with design decisions

| Week | Topic | Engineering Focus | Badge Alignment |

### Phase 4: Demonstration (Week 16) - "Badge Defense"
**Badge Objective**: Explain design decisions and reflect on code

- Project presentations
- Code review and defense
- Portfolio completion
- **Capstone Due** (Badge candidates only)

## Assessment Mapping

### Two Major Projects (Badge Requirement)
1. **CYOA Game** (Week 8): Demonstrates control structures, functions, recursion
