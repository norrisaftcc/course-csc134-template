# Free and Open Source C++ Resources for CSC 134

## About These Resources

Community college students face enough financial barriers without expensive textbooks adding to the burden. These carefully selected free resources provide a complete C++ learning ecosystem that matches or exceeds traditional textbooks while offering superior interactivity and regular updates.

Each resource serves a specific learning need: comprehensive tutorials for conceptual understanding, professional development environments for hands-on practice, visualization tools for debugging skills, and structured curricula for academic rigor. Together, they create a zero-cost learning environment that saves students $200-400 per semester while providing access to current industry practices.

## Keep In Mind

**Start small** - Begin with LearnCpp.com for reading and GitHub Codespaces for coding practice. Add other tools gradually rather than overwhelming yourself with options.

**Think industry-relevant** - These tools mirror what professionals actually use, so learning them serves double duty for education and career preparation.

**Free tiers have limits** - Plan around usage caps and teach students to manage their allocations wisely.

**Backup plans matter** - Free resources occasionally change terms or go offline. Having multiple options ensures continuity.
