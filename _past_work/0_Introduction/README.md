# Student Introductions

This directory will contain introduction files from all students in the course.

Each student should create a file named `[github-username].md` following the template in the [Pull Request exercise](../02_first_pull_request.md).

This demonstrates:
- The GitHub workflow
- Collaborative development
- How multiple people can work on the same project

## Example Files
As students complete the exercise, their introductions will appear here!
