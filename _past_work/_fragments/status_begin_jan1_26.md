  Summary

  - 3 closed, 4 open
  - Issue #7 is blocking - Recommendation and Data Tracking engines have no GRD input from GRAY
  - Issues #5, #6, #8 are actionable when ready

    let's continue working with different agents as relevant, using issues and
  pull requests (gh auth is live), and:
  - check to see what new GRD documents have been posted, if any, so we know
  where the gap analysis stands
  - continue with relevant issues as listed from the last session. Please let
  me know if I can provide clarification.
