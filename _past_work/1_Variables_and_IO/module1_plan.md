- Students identify requirements from problem descriptions
- Solutions build incrementally toward complete applications
- Real-world constraints guide design decisions

### Multiple Learning Style Support
- **Visual:** Flowcharts and diagrams in assignment descriptions
- **Aural:** Optional video walkthroughs for each assignment
- **Read/Write:** Comprehensive written instructions with examples
- **Kinesthetic:** Hands-on coding with immediate feedback

### GitHub Workflow Integration
- Each assignment requires proper commit messages
- Pull request for final submission
- Issue tracking for questions/clarifications
- Peer code reviews (optional enhancement)

## Assessment Strategy

### Rubric Categories (100 points each assignment)
1. **Functionality (40%)** - Program works correctly
2. **Code Quality (25%)** - Style, organization, efficiency
3. **Documentation (15%)** - Comments, headers, clarity
4. **Professional Practice (10%)** - GitHub workflow, commits
5. **Problem Solving (10%)** - Approach and completeness
