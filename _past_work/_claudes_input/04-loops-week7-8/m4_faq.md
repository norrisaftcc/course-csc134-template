Common Issues and Solutions
Issue 1: Menu Doesn't Loop
Problem: Menu shows once then program ends
Solution: Wrap menu in do-while or while loop
Issue 2: Can't Exit Loops
Problem: No way to return to main menu
Solution: Add "back" or "return" option in submenus
Issue 3: Statistics Don't Update
Problem: Counters not incrementing
Solution: Check scope - are variables resetting?
Issue 4: Input Buffer Issues
Problem: Program skips input or reads old input
Solution: Use cin.ignore() after reading numbers before strings

Submission Requirements

project2.cpp - Complete source code
testing_log.txt - Test cases and results
user_guide.txt - How to play/use your program
reflection.txt - 300 words on:

What was the hardest part?
Which loop type was most useful?
How did you handle input validation?
What are you most proud of?
What would you add with more time?




AI Usage Guidelines (IMPORTANT!)
Week 7-8: Still No Code Generation!
Claude/Flash CANNOT:

Write your loops
Provide complete validation code
Give you menu structures
Fix your code directly

Claude/Flash CAN:

Help understand error messages
Discuss why loops might not terminate
Explain concepts
Help plan program structure

Week 9 Starts AI Code Generation!
After Project 2 submission, you can start using AI for code generation with proper documentation.

Excellence Indicators
What Makes an A+ Project

Impossible to Break - No input can crash it
Professional Polish - Feels like real software
Engaging Gameplay - Want to play multiple times
Clean Code - Another student could modify easily
Creative Features - Surprises and delights
Complete Documentation - Clear, thorough testing


Grading Timeline

On time (End of Week 8): Full credit possible
1 day late: Maximum 90%
2 days late: Maximum 80%
3+ days late: Maximum 70%


Support Resources

Example Videos: Posted on Canvas
Office Hours: Extended hours Week 8!
Discord: #project2-help channel
Peer Review: Thursday Week 8 in class


Final Advice
The Three Laws of Loops

Every loop must have an exit - No infinite loops!
Validate everything - Users will enter garbage
Test the boundaries - First iteration, last iteration, and beyond

Start Simple, Build Up

Get a basic menu working
Add one feature at a time
Test after each addition
Polish at the end

You've Got This!
This project proves you can build real software. You have all the fundamental tools. The only difference between your project and professional software is scale, not capability.
Remember Week 9: After you submit Project 2, you unlock AI code generation. But first, prove you can do it yourself. That's what makes you a real programmer!

Week 8 Victory Speech
"Congratulations! You've conquered the fundamentals. You've written functions, made decisions, and mastered loops. You've debugged infinite loops, handled bad input, and built complete programs. You ARE a programmer. Welcome to the guild!" 🎮🏆✨
