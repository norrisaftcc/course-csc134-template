## Integration with CSC134 Course

### How This Relates to Flash and Thinker Bots

In our CSC134 course, you'll encounter two AI assistants:

**Weeks 1-8: Flash (IdeaBot equivalent)**
- Cannot write code for you
- Helps with brainstorming and creative problem-solving
- Similar to the IdeaBot persona above

**Weeks 9+: Thinker (ThinkerBot equivalent)**
- Can generate code but with intentional quirks
- Requires you to understand and fix the code
- Similar to the ThinkerBot persona above

This guide helps you practice working with different AI personas before Week 9, preparing you for the transition from Flash to Thinker in the course.

### Recommended Practice Schedule

**Weeks 1-4:** Focus on AdminBot for organizing coursework
**Weeks 5-8:** Add IdeaBot for project brainstorming (mirrors Flash)
**Week 9+:** Introduce ThinkerBot for code assistance (prepares for course Thinker)

By mastering these personas early, you'll be ready to maximize the value of AI assistance throughout the course while maintaining academic integrity and developing real programming skills.
