# Module 02: Functions - Breaking Down Problems Like a Pro Chef
## Weeks 3-4 | Badge: Program Design and Implementation

## 🎯 Module Overview

**Duration**: Weeks 3-4 (4 class sessions)  
**Project**: Restaurant Management System  
**Badge Alignment**: Program Design, Software Development Practices  
**AI Support**: Flash can help you brainstorm and communicate (but not write code!)

### This Module's Superpower
By the end of Week 4, you'll transform from writing 100-line chaos to organized, reusable code. Functions are THE fundamental skill that separates beginners from programmers.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- [ ] Create and call void functions
- [ ] Pass arguments to functions
- [ ] Understand scope (what happens in functions, stays in functions)
- [ ] Use function prototypes to organize code
- [ ] Pass by value vs. pass by reference
- [ ] Debug function-related errors systematically
- [ ] Write a complete multi-function program

## 📖 Module Contents

### Week 3: Function Fundamentals
- **Chapter 3**: [Introduction to Functions](chapter-03-functions.md)
  - Your first function
  - Function anatomy and flow of control
  - Function prototypes
  - The kitchen metaphor

### Week 4: Advanced Functions
- **Chapter 4**: [Parameters and Scope](chapter-04-parameters.md)

  - The magic portal explanation

### Practice Exercises
- `exercises/practice-03-basic-functions.cpp` - Basic function creation
- `exercises/practice-04-parameters.cpp` - Working with parameters
- `exercises/practice-05-scope.cpp` - Understanding scope

### Project: Restaurant Management System
Build a professional restaurant ordering system using everything you've learned!
- See `project-restaurant/` for starter code and requirements
- Creative freedom encouraged (K-Pop Fusion? Viking Feast Hall? Your choice!)

### AI Assistant Guide

## 🏆 Assessment

### Restaurant System Project (100 points)
| Component | Points | Requirements |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Function Organization** | 25 | At least 6 meaningful functions |
| **Parameter Usage** | 25 | Correct use including 2+ reference parameters |
| **Code Runs** | 20 | Compiles and executes without crashes |
| **User Experience** | 15 | Clear prompts, formatted output |
| **Code Quality** | 10 | Good names, comments, indentation |
| **Flash Debugging Log** | 5 | Shows problem-solving process |

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Your Escalation Path:
1. **Try to compile** - Read the FIRST error carefully
2. **Add cout statements** - See what values actually are
3. **Ask Flash** - "How do I debug an undefined reference error?"
4. **Check Discord** - #week3-functions channel
5. **Office Hours** - Bring your Flash conversation log
6. **Email Instructor** - Flash can help you write a clear technical email!

## 💡 Pro Tips from Previous Students

> "Draw boxes for each function and arrows for data flow. It really helps!" - Maria, now at GameDev Studios

> "Name functions like verbs: calculateTax(), displayMenu(). Makes everything clearer." - James

> "I spent 30 minutes with Flash designing 'Raccoon's Trash Panda Tacos' theme. The instructor loved it!" - David

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Next module (Weeks 5-6) you'll add DECISION MAKING to your functions:
- if/else statements
- switch cases
- Boolean logic
- Your restaurant will get smart about orders!

## Module 2 Motto
### "A function should do one thing, do it well, and do it only"
*- Unix Philosophy (and good life advice)*

You're 25% through the course. You can now write organized, reusable code. That's huge! 🎉
