## Submission Requirements

1. **Source Code**: `restaurant.cpp`
2. **Flash Log**: `flash-conversation.txt`
3. **Sample Output**: `sample-run.txt`
4. **README**: Brief description of your theme and special features

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ All code in main() - USE FUNCTIONS!
- ❌ No input validation - Handle bad input gracefully
- ❌ Forgetting & for reference parameters
- ❌ Prices hardcoded throughout - Use constants
- ❌ No theme or personality - Have fun with it!

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start with Flash**: Brainstorm your theme and menu items
2. **Plan your functions**: List what each will do before coding
3. **Build incrementally**: Get basic version working, then add features
4. **Test frequently**: Run after adding each function
5. **Make it yours**: The best projects show personality!

## Grading Notes

- Creativity and effort are rewarded!
- Going beyond minimum requirements can earn bonus points
- Clean, well-organized code is valued over complex features
- Show your learning process in the Flash log

Remember: This project should be FUN! Pick a theme that excites you and let your creativity shine! 🌟
