# CSC 134: C++ Programming Course Setup

## Welcome to Your C++ Journey! 🚀

This course introduces object-oriented computer programming using the C++ programming language through progressive, project-based learning. You'll build real software while earning a professional badge that certifies your programming competency.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Design and implement C++ programs** that solve real-world problems
2. **Apply object-oriented programming principles** including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
3. **Debug programs systematically** using professional tools and techniques
4. **Manage program data** using variables, arrays, and file I/O operations
5. **Create modular code** using functions and classes
6. **Validate user input** and handle errors gracefully
7. **Document code professionally** and explain design decisions

## Badge Certification Requirements

To earn the **Foundations of C++ Programming with Object-Oriented Principles Badge**, you must:

- ✅ Complete all weekly assignments and labs
- ✅ Submit two major programming projects with demonstrated debugging
- ✅ Pass a capstone project including:
  - Requirements analysis
  - Object-oriented design
  - Implementation with testing
  - Design decision documentation
- ✅ Demonstrate ability to explain and reflect on code

## Course Philosophy

> "Every expert was once a beginner. Every professional programmer has written an infinite loop. The difference? The expert hits Ctrl+C faster!"

This course embraces:
- **Learning through building** - Every concept connects to a real project
- **Celebrating mistakes** - Bugs are teachers in disguise
- **Progressive challenge** - Start simple, build toward complexity
- **Inclusive support** - Multiple learning styles and backgrounds welcome

## The RPG Project Thread 🎮

Throughout this course, you'll build an evolving Role-Playing Game (RPG) that naturally introduces programming concepts:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Character stats system (variables, I/O)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Combat functions (functions, parameters)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Choose Your Own Adventure (decisions, branching)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Game menu system (loops, validation)
- **Week 9**: Transition to AI-assisted development
- **Weeks 10-12**: Party management (arrays, file saves)
- **Weeks 13-15**: Full OOP redesign (classes, SOLID principles)
- **Week 16**: Portfolio presentation and badge defense

## Course Structure

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-8) - "Earn Your C"
- Build core programming skills
- **NO AI code generation** - understanding comes first
- Focus on syntax, logic, and problem-solving

### Phase 2: AI-Assisted Engineering (Weeks 9-12) - "Build Your B"
- Introduction to AI tools as programming assistants
- Learn to generate, understand, and modify code
- Emphasis on STL algorithms and modern C++

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts (Weeks 13-15) - "Achieve Your A"
- Object-oriented design principles
- SOLID principles in game development
- Professional software engineering practices

### Phase 4: Demonstration (Week 16) - "Badge Defense"
- Portfolio presentation
- Code review and explanation
- Capstone project defense

## Success Strategies

1. **Code every day** - Even 15 minutes maintains momentum
2. **Debug with purpose** - Every error teaches something
3. **Ask questions** - Confusion is the first step to understanding
4. **Share struggles** - You're not alone in finding this challenging
5. **Celebrate small wins** - Compiling without errors IS an achievement!

## What Makes This Course Special

- **Project-based from day one** - No abstract exercises
- **Visual learning aids** - Flowcharts, diagrams, and ASCII art
- **Gamification elements** - Level up through achievements
- **Modern C++ practices** - Industry-relevant skills
- **Portfolio development** - Build showcase-worthy projects

## Ready to Begin?

Your adventure starts with setting up your development environment. Don't worry - we'll guide you through every step. By the end of Week 1, you'll have written your first C++ program and taken your first steps toward becoming a programmer.

Remember: **The syntax might feel weird now, but soon you'll be writing C++ as naturally as texting a friend.**
