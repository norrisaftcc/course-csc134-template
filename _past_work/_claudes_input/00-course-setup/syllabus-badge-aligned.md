## Assessment Rubric Alignment

### Minimum Scores for Badge Award

Each project and the capstone must achieve at least **3 (Proficient)** in all domains:

| Domain | Level 1: Developing | Level 2: Approaching | Level 3: Proficient | Level 4: Exemplary |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Functionality** | Program has errors | Mostly works | All requirements met | Exceeds requirements |
| **Code Quality** | Poor organization | Some structure | Well-organized | Professional quality |
| **Documentation** | Minimal comments | Basic comments | Clear documentation | Comprehensive docs |
| **Design Decisions** | No clear design | Some planning | Thoughtful design | Innovative solutions |
| **Debugging Evidence** | No debugging shown | Some attempts | Systematic approach | Advanced techniques |

## Badge Portfolio Requirements

### Required Components
1. **All weekly lab exercises** (formative assessment)
2. **Four major projects** showing progression:
   - Project 1: Procedural programming mastery
   - Project 2: Control structures and validation
   - Project 3: Arrays and file handling
   - Project 4: Object-oriented design
3. **Capstone project** including:
   - Requirements document
   - Design diagrams (flowcharts/UML)
   - Complete implementation
   - Test plan and results
   - Reflection essay (500 words)
4. **AI interaction logs** (Weeks 9-16)
5. **Debugging journal** with solved bugs

### Quality Standards
